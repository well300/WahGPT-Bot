# WahGPT - WhatsApp Chatbot with ChatGPT Integration

WahGPT is a WhatsApp chatbot built using the `@whiskeysockets/baileys` library, allowing users to interact with an intelligent chatbot powered by GPT (ChatGPT4). This README provides a comprehensive explanation of the code structure and functionality.

## Features

- **WhatsApp Integration:** Utilizes `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to connect to the WhatsApp Web platform, enabling the bot to send and receive messages.
- **GPT Integration:** Communicates with the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- WhatsApp account and a phone with an active internet connection.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/well300/WahGPT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd WahGPT
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Scan the QR code displayed with your WhatsApp Web to authenticate.

## Code Structure

### 1. Initialization

The script initializes the WhatsApp client and sets up event listeners for authentication, QR code display, and readiness.

### 2. Authentication and State Management

It manages authentication state using the `useMultiFileAuthState` function from `@whiskeysockets/baileys`.

### 3. Message Processing

The bot listens for incoming messages and interacts with the ChatGPT API to generate responses.

### 4. Connection Handling

Event listeners handle connection updates, such as QR code display, connection establishment, and disconnection.

### 5. Error Handling

The script includes error handling to gracefully manage API errors and other exceptions.

## Usage

1. Send messages to the WhatsApp number associated with the bot.
2. Experience intelligent responses generated by ChatGPT.
